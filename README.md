# AirMaster

I created an "endless run" game, similar to flappy birds, but is orianted vertically instead of orizontally. The idea of the game is to pass as more pipes as you can with an airplane, which can move right-left.

In the making of this project, I used the next components:
1. One display
2. One joystick, used for airplane's movements
3. A 8x8 matrix used for running and printing the game
4. MAX7219 driver used for an easier control of the matrix
5. 2 breadboards
6. 2 LEDs for interactiv playing

The game has increasing level dificulty (once at x seconds, the speed will raise with some speed), score and 3-life system.

### Game instructions:

* You participate at an aeronautic tournament, where you have to be the best! We give you an airplane, which you will control with the help of the joystick, on left-right directions. If you want to show off your skills, you just have survive as long as you can.


### Tehnical details:

* I added a button for starting the game.
